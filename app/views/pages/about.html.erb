                <p>
                    11 years ago, I started coaching ski racing. It's a sport that I love and love to give back to. Over the years, I've come to appreciate just how challenging of a sport it is for both skiers and coaches. With this understanding, I've for years tried to come up with a solution to the problem of our limited time spent with each athlete during a practice. Over the years, I've estimated that during a typical 2 hour practice, I only get to spend ~2 minutes of quality face to face time with each athlete.   </p>

                    Over the range of ~54 hours a supremely talented team of designers, developers, entrepreneurs, and local industry experts crafted a cool eCommerce Box service. This Service, which came to be known as Startbox was built with the intent of sending quarterly boxed kits inspired by Pinterest projects.</p>
