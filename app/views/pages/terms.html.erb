				<strong>Pricing for Paid Lessons</strong></p><br /><p>
				Key Definitions</p><br /><p>
				"Base Price" means the course price set by the Instructor.</p><br /><p>
				"Base Currency" means the currency of the Base Price.</p><br /><p>
				"Sale Price" means the actual sale price for the Course. When the Sale Currency is different from the Base Currency, the Company will determine the Sale Price based on the applicable Base Exchange Rate and Cost Adjustment Factor.</p><br /><p>
				"Sale Currency" means the currency of the sale. This is determined by the country of origin of the User purchasing the Course.</p><br /><p>
				"Cost Adjustment Factor" means applicable local taxes and other fees associated with currency conversions. In regions that use a common currency, e.g., the EU, the Cost Adjustment Factor uses a weighted average of country specific tax rates to ensure the same prices to end customers across the region.</p><br /><p>
				<strong>Pricing</strong></p><br /><p>
				Except when a Course is made available through the SkiCoach.me Marketing Programs, an Instructor will be solely responsible for determining the Base Price to be charged for such Course, in accordance with the Instructor Terms. When the Sale Currency is different than the Base Currency, the Company will determine the Sale Price according to the most recent Base Exchange Rate and applicable Cost Adjustment Factor.</p><br /><p>
				If You are a Student, You agree to pay the fees for Lessons that You take, and hereby authorize Us to charge Your credit card for these amounts. We will charge Your credit card monthly for all amounts owed. If Your credit card is declined, You agree to pay Us the fees within thirty (30) days of notification from Us, and pay (at Our discretion) a late payment charge at 1.5% per month, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is greater.</p><br /><p>				
				<strong>Rounding Off</strong></p><br /><p>
				Company may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the Sale Price to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the Sale Currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Company will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p><br /><p>
				Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Company may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Company to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p><br /><p>
